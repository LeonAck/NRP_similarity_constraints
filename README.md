This repository contains the code for running an ALNS with Simulated Annealing, as part of my master's thesis "Personnel schedules consistent with past schedules."

The core of the heuristic is found in leon_thesis/invoke. leon_thesis/invoke/main.py contains the function to run a single instance. 
The input is prepared is Input/prepare_input.py and the raw data is contained in the directory Input/sceschia-nurserostering.
